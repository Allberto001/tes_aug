            <p class="para">Im 25 and i was born in Miami fl on November 13, 1992 but my mother is from chichigalpa in Nicaragua and my
                father is from isabela Puerto Rico. I like to believe that i'm a social person and always love meeting new people to network, 
                seeing that you never know who you are going to meet in life. Currently i work for Comcast as a sales rep
                and deal with a lot people in a day to day basis. I'd say with the time i've been with the company which is about 5 years from when 
                i made this website it has made me good at solving problems and coming up with differennt ways to a reach a solution to my customers 
                issues with their services or packages. One of my favorite things about myself is the fact that im a self taught drummer and it's
                always been my favorite instrument so when i was given the chance at the age of 21 to play for a church, i put my head into it
                and learned enough to get me through and keep getting better as i go.
